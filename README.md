# Ansible Role: stunnel

## Description

Ansible role for install stunnel.

    Stunnel is a proxy designed to add TLS encryption functionality
    to existing clients and servers without any changes in the
    programs' code. Its architecture is optimized for security,
    portability, and scalability (including load-balancing),
    making it suitable for large deployments.
